Freitas’s death is the latest in a centuries-long record of racist violence in Brazil, where more than 75 percent of the 5,800 people killed by police last year were Black.\n\nThe killing occurred on the eve of Dia da Consciência Negra (Black Consciousness Day), observed annually on November 20 to commemorate the death of Zumbi, a Black activist and former enslaved person who fought to free others from enslavement.\n\nAs historic protests against systemic racism continue in the US, Brazil is facing its own reckoning. The words “Black Lives Matter” resounded across the nation as early as this spring, prompted in part by the fatal shooting of 14-year-old João Pedro Mattos Pinto by police in a favela in Rio de Janeiro just a week before the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-53484698&entry.783602727=&entry.","imageUrl":"https://i0.wp.com/hyperallergic-newspack.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/11/PHOTO-2020-11-30-11-57-50.jpg?w=1280&quality=100&ssl=1","localImg":"blm_murals226","peaceSign":false,"plainText":"#SILENCIO É APAGAMENTO","designType":"1-color (non-yellow)","newsSource":["https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2020/11/28/frase-silencio-e-apagamento-e-pintada-no-minhocao-em-sp.ghtml"],"panAfrican":false,"redLetters":false,"blueLetters":false,"description":"#SILENCIO É APAGAMENTO (\"Silence is Erasure\") written in white traffic paint on pavement on an elevated highway.","photoCredit":"aerial photo by @volpeimagens, @lucasaalfaro, and @osso_raw;

The city gave Voces de la Frontera a permit to host a block party from 8am-5pm and to paint the mural with tempera paint. Voces de los Artistas (and the Art Build Workers) took a key role in organizing the street painting action, the banner painting stations, and the screen printing but the partnerships are much more complex. It was artists working directly in a movement. It was the power of an art affinity group (Voces de los Artistas) in a movement (Voces de la Frontera.) It was the power of youth organizing – YES! (Youth Empowered in the Struggle) with Voces. It was the power of allies in the community volunteering their time and energy.
